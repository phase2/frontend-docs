`apps/pl/`

Refer to the [Pattern Lab Documentation](http://patternlab.io/docs) for extensive info on how to use it. Particle is a custom Pattern Lab 2 *Edition* that is heavily influenced by the [Drupal Edition of Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-drupal-standard) and uses the Twig engine to bring it inline with Drupal 8's use of Twig.

The `app/pl` folder simply imports the design system from `source/` and provides its own custom Sass for UI and json generation. Any Twig files that change in `source/` cause a full Pattern Lab rebuild. The Pattern Lab engine and config lives within `apps/pl/pattern-lab`.

#### `Faker` data in Pattern Lab

[`Faker`](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) generates fake data and the [Faker plugin for Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-faker) is used here. This generates *different* fake content for each compile, and allows [translated content](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-faker#locales) as well.

**Faker only works in the global data files** found in `source/_data/` currently until [this bug](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-faker/issues/2) is fixed.

Use it like this in `source/_data/data.json`:

```json
{
  "description": "Faker.paragraph",
  "text": "Faker.words(3, true)",
  "byline": "Faker.sentence",
  "intro": "Faker.sentences(2, true)"
}
```

The formatters (things like `.paragraph`, `.words`, etc) can accept options, when you see `Faker.words(3, true)` that means give me 3 random words and I'd like them as a string and not an array of strings. All the [formatters and their options are documented here](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#formatters) - there's tons: numbers, address, names, dates, and more.
