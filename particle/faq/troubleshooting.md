# Troubleshooting

The console output from Particle and the Webpack dev server should give you output of any errors, including linting, unexpected or missing characters, etc.

If changes you've made aren't appearing on the page, try shutting down the dev server with `Ctrl + C` in Bash and restarting it with `npm start`.
